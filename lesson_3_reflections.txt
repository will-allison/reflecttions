When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other people or when youw ant to share your repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you and a colleague may be working on the same file at the same time. Their changes could overwrite yours.
